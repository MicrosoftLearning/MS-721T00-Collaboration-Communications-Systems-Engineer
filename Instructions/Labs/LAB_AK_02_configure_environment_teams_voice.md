# Lab 02: Configure your environment for Teams Phone
# Student lab answer key

## Lab scenario

Contoso wants to set up Teams Phone for their users. 

Firstly, our administrator wants to ensure the network is capable of running Microsoft teams, we will do this by completing the following tasks:

- Evaluate our network bandwidth with Network Planner

- Test our network performance with the Teams Network Assessment

Next, we need to configure our tenant ready for acquiring phone numbers and assigning them to users, before we can acquire and assign phone numbers we need to configure our network topology and emergency calling addresses

- Configure a basic network topology and emergency calling addresses

Voice Policies allow us to configure specific parts of Teams Phone. We require extension dialing and call park and some of our users do not want their numbers presented when making outbound calls. Finally, there is a number we wish to block from making inbound calls to Contoso. 

- Configure Voice policies to meet Contoso requirements

Now we will acquire and assign phone numbers to a user and perform a test call and configure audio conferencing for our users

- Assign licenses and phone numbers to a user for calling

- Configure audio conferencing

Finally, we will configure Call Queues and Auto Attendants for inbound calls to Contoso

- Configure Call Queues and Auto Attendants 

## Lab Setup

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 155 minutes

You have successfully generated a Network Planner Report. We can see from the results that, at the default of 30% allowed bandwidth for Microsoft Teams reserved for real-time communications the Tacoma site is fine for bandwidth, but the Bellevue site does not have enough, as we can see by the figure highlighted in red. It would be recommended to increase the internet bandwidth at the Bellevue site.

## Exercise 2: Use the Teams Network Assessment Tool

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will install and run the Teams Network Assessment Tool to check the connectivity and performance from a client machine.

You have successfully installed the Teams Network Assessment Tool onto Client01.

### Task 2 - Run the Network Connectivity Check

The Teams Network Assessment Tool is run from the command line. We will now run the network connectivity check, which requires no command line switches. Firstly, the tool will check if it has connectivity to the Teams media relay. These are used to relay audio and video when direct connection between clients is not possible. The checker also checks whether the load-balancer relay is QoS (Quality of Service) capable, which means the load-balancer redirects packets to relay instance ports 3479-3481 (instead of 3478) depending on modality (audio = 3479, video = 3480, screenshare/data = 3481).

1. You are still signed in to **MS721-CLIENT01** as **Admin** with the password provided to you.

1. Select **Start**, enter command prompt, find **Command Prompt** and right select it and chose **Run as administrator**.

1. At the “do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device” prompt, select **Yes**.

1. The command prompt will appear.

1. Type **cd C:\NetworkTest** and press enter, this changes our directory to the NetworkTest Directory.

1. Enter **NetworkAssessmentTool.exe** and press enter to run that program.

1. You will get a **Windows Defender Firewall Prompt;** Ensure Public networks is checked and select **Allow Access**.

1. The test will complete, and you will see *"Service connectivity result has been written to:"* and a file path, and be put back at the command prompt.

You have started the Network Assessment Tool for the first time.

### Task 3 - Interpret the results of the Network Connectivity Check

In the following task, you will read the results from the network connectivity check.:

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” and with the Network Assessment Tool open.

1. You can see from the command prompt output that the tests have been completed successfully, you can see:

	- Relay connectivity and QoS (Media Priority) check is successful for all relays.

	- Service verifications completed successfully.

You have successfully reviewed the results of the network connectivity check.

### Task 4 - Run the Network Quality Check

The network quality check (performance test) is run with the NetworkAssessmentTool.exe /qualitycheck switch. This will test sending real packets across the network.

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as **Admin** with the command prompt running.

1. Enter **cd C:\NetworkTest** and press enter, this changes our directory to the NetworkTest Directory.

1. Enter **NetworkAssessmentTool.exe /qualitycheck** and press enter to run that program.

1. Select **Allow** on any Windows Firewall popups that appear, to let the Network Assessment Tool through the firewall.

1. This will now run the test, you will see output come up on the command prompt, note you can see the **Loss Rate**, **Latency** and **Jitter** as the tests are performed.

1. The test will run for 300 seconds with tests every 5 seconds, we will finish the test early. After 10 or more tests have been completed, press **Ctrl+C** to stop the test.

1. When the test is complete, you will see the output *"Call Quality Check Has Finished Call Quality Check result has been written to:"* and a file path, and be put back at the command prompt.

### Task 5 - Interpret Results of the Network Quality Check

In the following task, you will review the results of the Network Quality Check.

- **Packet loss**: This is often defined as a percentage of packets that are lost in a given window of time. Packet loss directly affects audio quality—from small, individual lost packets having almost no impact to back-to-back burst losses that cause audio to cut out completely.

- **Latency:** This is the time it takes to get an IP packet from point A to point B on the network. This network propagation delay is essentially tied to the physical distance between the two points and the speed of light, including additional overhead taken by the various routers in between. Latency is measured as one-way or round-trip time.

- **Inter-packet arrival jitter, or simply jitter:** This is the average change in delay between successive packets. Most modern VoIP software, including Skype for Business, can adapt to some levels of jitter through buffering. It's only when the jitter exceeds the buffering that a participant will notice the effects of jitter.

Review Packet Loss, Latency and Jitter by following these steps:

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as **Admin** and at the command prompt.

1. Enter the following into the command prompt:

    ```console
    cd %userprofile%"\AppData\Local\Microsoft Teams Network Assessment Tool\"
    ```

1. Press **Tab** to tab through files in that directory, when you see a file name ending in **_quality_check_results.csv** press **Enter** to open the file. 

1. Select the top right X to close the activation prompt when excel loads. You can now see your test results in Excel.

1. Close Excel and the command prompt when complete

Microsoft’s performance targets for Teams are:

- **LossRate %**, also called Packet loss <0.1% during any 15s interval – the tests are 5 seconds each, so we should not be breaching this threshold

- **AverageLatency-Ms, (one way)** **&lt; 50ms**

- **AverageJitter-Ms, &lt;30ms during any 15s interval**

Note, due to performing the test on a lab VM, you may see unusual or high results, especially with latency.

At the end of this task, you have successfully reviewed the results of the Network Quality Check.

## Exercise 3: Configure a basic network topology for dynamic emergency calling 

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 20 minutes

Network sites are used for Dynamic emergency calling. Before configuring dynamic emergency calling we must map the relevant Network Regions, Network sites, network subnets and Trusted IP addresses. In this exercise, we will configure a network region and sites

### Task 1 - Add Network Region and sites to Network Topology

You have now added our network sites; Tacoma, and Bellevue.

### Task 2 - Add a trusted IP address

In this task, you will add a trusted IP addresses for each of the Tacoma and Bellevue Offices. Trusted IP addresses are the enterprise's public external IP addresses that a Teams user will show as routing from on the public internet. These are important as they validate that the user is on an enterprise network and the system should check if they are on a mapped subnet. We have two offices, each with its own internet connection and therefore its own public IP address. You do not need to map Trusted IPs to specific networks.

1. From the last task, you are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” and have the **Microsoft Teams Admin Center** open as **Allan Deyoung**.

1. On **Network topology**, select the **Trusted IPs** tab.

1. You will see “You haven't added any trusted IP addresses yet”. Select **Add**

1. You can add a specific IP or a subnet of public IPs, For the Bellevue office add **151.101.128.81** and **32** as the network range and in the description enter **Bellevue Office Public IP Addresses**.

1. Select **Apply**.

1. Select **Add** to add our second Public IP address.

1. In the **Emergency locations** list verify your emergency location is listed and has been validated.

1. Leave the browser open in the **Microsoft Teams admin center** at the end of this task.

You have successfully added an emergency address

### Task 4 - Mapping a network to a physical location (emergency address)

Now that we have added our network Region, Sites and Subnets we can map our network locations to physical office addresses for emergency calling. 

> [!TIP]
> This configuration refers to Emergency Locations, but when you are defining them, the Teams Admin Center calls them Emergency Addresses. They are the same thing.

> [!NOTE]
> The below information explains general best practices for implementing emergency services in Microsoft Teams. None of the information in this document should be interpreted as legal advice. Please consult with your organization's legal department and the following resources for specific requirements by state.

- https://www.intrado.com/enterprise-solutions/e911-regulations
- https://www.911.gov/

US law states that a user utilizing a phone system that supports dynamic emergency dialing must be able to be dynamically have their location determined at the time of the 911 call in order to route the call to the correct/nearest Public Service Answering Point (PSAP). (Kari's Law). It also states that an internal notification be setup to where at least one individual in the organization be notified that a person placed and emergency call and where their location is. (Ray Baums Act) We use the LIS database in Microsoft Teams to map our physical sites out so that emergency calls will connect.

You can map emergency location\addresses to:

- Wireless Access Point (WAP) by BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) - Each AP radio has its own unique BSSID per SSID.

- Ethernet switch port, which maps both the Chassis ID and the port ID. This allows a switch that spans multiple locations to be more accurately mapped down to the port.

- Ethernet switch by Chassis ID. Each network switch is stamped with a Chassis ID that is used to identify a specific switch on a network.

- Subnet. Not tied to any physical equipment address, this is the network address the user has. Unlike mapped subnets in the Teams Network topology, The Location Information Service (LIS) doesn’t maintain a list of Networks and Subnet masks, it relies on the NetworkID of the subnet.

Microsoft Teams utilizes the following flowchart of determining a user's network location:

  ![Flowchart of How Microsoft Teams utilizes the network data of determining a user to determine their location.](./Linked_Image_Files/M02_L02_E04_T04_01.png)

Perform the following steps.

1. From the last task, you are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” and have the **Microsoft Teams Admin Center** open as **Allan Deyoung**.

1. Navigate to **Locations** and **Networks &amp; locations**.

1. We are going to map our office **Subnets;** ensure you are on the Subnets tab and select **Add** to add a subnet and Emergency Location.

1. Leave IPv4 Selected for **IP Version**.

1. Enter the Bellevue Subnet network ID, since our Bellevue Office subnet is 10.10.20.0/24, the network ID is **10.10.20.0**. Additionally also add **192.168.0.0** for a later task.

1. Enter **Bellevue Subnet** as the **Description**.

1. Under Emergency location, **Search by City** enter **Bellevue** and select our Bellevue emergency address.

1. Select **Apply**.

1. Leave the browser open in the **Microsoft Teams admin center** at the end of this task.

You have aligned a network subnet to a physical emergency address.

### Task 5 - Configure Emergency Calling Policies

In this task, you will configure an emergency calling policy. Emergency calling policies define what happens when a user in your organization makes an emergency call. We would like Alex Wilber to receive a notification whenever an emergency call is made.

1. From the last task, you are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” and have the **Microsoft Teams Admin Center** open as **Allan Deyoung**.

1. In the left navigation pane select **Voice** and **Emergency polices**.

1. Select **Add** to add an Emergency Policy.

1. For **Name** enter **Contoso Emergency Policy**.

1. For **Description** enter **Contoso Emergency Policy**.

1. Turn on **External location lookup mode**.

1. Under **Emergency numbers**, select **+ Add**

1. Enter **999** as the **Emergency dial string**.

1. Under **Notification mode**, select **Send notification only**: A Teams chat message is sent to the users and groups that you specify.

1. Under **Users and groups for emergency calls notifications**, enter Alex and then select Alex Wilber and select **Add**.

1. Select **Apply** and then **Save** to finish creating your emergency calling policy.

1. Leave the browser open in the **Microsoft Teams admin center** at the end of this task.

You have successfully set up notifications for Alex Wilber whenever emergency calls are made.

## Exercise 4: Configure voice policies

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure some key voice settings and policies required for the Contoso users to utilize voice services in context with the company policies.

### Task 1 - Create a Dial Plan for extension dialing

In this task, you will sign into the Client01 and the Teams Admin Center and configure a dial plan. Our Tacoma office users are used to using 3 digit short codes to call users internally, from 500 to 550. These 3 digit codes map 1:1 to the last 3 digits of their PSTN number. In Tacoma, the numbers are +44208 566 5xx. XX represents 00 to 99, We own this number range for the Tacoma users.

So, for example, if a user’s phone number is +44208 566 511, employees are used to being able to dial 511 to ring that user.

We need to create a dial plan for Tacoma users to enable that scenario. While it is primarily Tacoma users who use this 5xx extension dialing, the organization has asked that Bellevue users should also be able to use the same extensions to dial Tacoma users. 

Since we want all users to be able to do 5xx extension dialing, we will add a new normalization rule to the Global dial plan, as this applies to all tenant users by default. If you only wanted to have the rule apply to selected users, you could create a specific dial plan and assign it to those users.

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” and have the **Microsoft Teams admin center** open as **Allan Deyoung**.

1. In the left navigation pane expand **Voice** then select **Dial plans**. 

1. Select the **Global (org wide default)** dial plan.

1. Under Normalization rules, you will see “You don't have any normalization rules yet”, select **Add** to get to the add new rule dialogue.

1. For **Name** enter **Tacoma 5xx extension dialing**.

1. For **Description** enter **Converts 5xx dialed extensions to full E.164 +142555515xx numbers**.

1. Ensure **Basic** rule is selected, it should be by default.

1. Check **The number dialed begins with** and enter **5**.

1. Check **The length of the number being dialed is** and enter **3**.

1. Ensure **Exactly** is selected for length of number to be dialed.

1. Check **Remove this many digits from the start of the number** and enter **1**.

1. Check **Add this number to the beginning** and enter **+142555515**.

1. Test the rule by entering **503** and selecting **Test**. The output should be +14255551503, if the output is correct select **Save**.

1. You will see your rule as rule 1 in the global dial plan, select **Save**.

1. Leave the browser open in the **Microsoft Teams admin center** at the end of this task.

You have successfully added a normalization rule to a dial plan to meet the extension dialing organizational requirement.

### Task 2 - Configure Calling policies

Calling policies are used to control which features are available to users. By default, when a user is on a Call in Teams, a second call coming in will alert them with a toast, giving them the option to pick up the second incoming call. Our organization does not want users interrupted when they are on calls. This feature is called “busy on busy”.

At Contoso, you need to enable the option of convenience recording 1:1 calls, which is disabled by default. Your labs Teams Administrator, Allan Deyoung will create a custom calling policy and apply it to all users via a Group policy assignment.

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” and have the **Microsoft Teams admin center** open as **Allan Deyoung**.

1. In the left navigation menu select **Voice** and **Calling policies**. 

1. Select **Add** to add a new policy.

1. Under **Add a name for your calling policy** enter **Busy on busy and call recording**.

1. Under add a **description** enter **Busy on busy and allow call recording**.

1. Switch **Cloud recording for calling** to **On**.

1. For **Busy on busy during calls** to **On**.

1. Select **Save**.

1. While still in Voice and calling policies, select the **Group policy assignment** tab.

1. Select **Add** to open the **Assign policy to group** dialogue.

1. Under **Select a group** search for **Sales Group** and when **Sales Group** appears, select **Add**.

1. Leave rank as **1**.

1. For select a policy select the new **Busy on busy and call recording** policy.

1. Select **Apply**.

1. Leave the browser open in the Microsoft Teams admin center at the end of this task.

The policy is now applied to all users in the **Sales Group** group. If a user is directly assigned a policy (either individually or through a batch assignment), that policy takes precedence over a policy inherited by being a member of a group. This leaves the option for specific users to be directly assigned a different policy should they want busy on busy disabled.

You have successfully created and assigned a calling policy.

### Task 3 - Configure Call Park policies

Call Park and retrieve lets users put calls on hold and enables the same user or someone else to retrieve and continue the call. Call Park is disabled by default. Our organization would like the option to use call park so we will enable it.

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” and have the **Microsoft Teams admin center** open as **Allan Deyoung**.

1. In the left navigation menu select **Voice** and **Call park policies**. 

1. Select the **Global (org wide default)** policy.

1. Switch **Call park** to **On**.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Leave the browser open in the **Microsoft Teams admin center** at the end of this task.

The call pickup range is from 10 to 99 but can be customized here. You have successfully enabled call park for all users.

### Task 4 - Configure Caller ID policies

Caller ID policies are used to change or block the Caller ID or phone number presented when making or receiving PSTN calls.

By default, the user's phone number is displayed when an outbound call is made to a PSTN phone number such as a landline or mobile phone. In most cases, most companies will be happy with this default. Some users in our organization do not want their number presented when they make outbound PSTN calls. In this task, we will create a Caller ID policy to block the presentation of any PSTN number, ready to be assigned to those users.

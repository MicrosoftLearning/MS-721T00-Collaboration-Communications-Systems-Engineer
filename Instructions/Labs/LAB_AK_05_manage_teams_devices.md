## Lab Scenario

As part of the expanding business, the organization has began deploying various types of Microsoft Teams devices in their organization. You need to manage the deployment of these devices.

## Lab Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 120 minutes

## Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Throughout this lab, you will use PowerShell cmdlets that must be customized for your specific lab configuration. In the instructions below, when you see &lt;LAB NUMBER&gt; in a PowerShell command, you should replace it with the LAB NUMBER obtained in Lab 3, Exercise 1, Task 2.
> You will also see &lt;TENANT NAME&GT; used in PowerShell commands and should replace it with the Microsoft 365 TENANT NAME (e.g. M365x01234567) for your Microsoft 365 account.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Teams Shared Device and Room Resource Accounts

## Exercise 2: Deploy Microsoft Teams Common Area Phones

In this exercise, you will create policies for Common Area Phones, apply the policy to the previously created user, and enable the phone for Teams Voice.

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 30 minutes

### Task 1 - Configure Microsoft Teams IP Phone Policies.

In this task, you will connect to Microsoft Teams PowerShell and create an IP Phone Policy for Common Area Phones. This policy removes the default user experience and locks the phone down so that it cannot be easily signed out of, and restricts the device to make and recieve calls. Access to other apps on the phone is prohibited.

1. You are still on **MS721-CLIENT01** where you are still signed in as “Admin”.

1. Select the Windows symbol in the task bar, type **PowerShell** and open a regular PowerShell window.

1. In Windows PowerShell, enter the following cmdlet to connect to Teams in your tenant:

    ```powershell
    Connect-MicrosoftTeams

    ```

    > NOTE: If you get an error stating that the MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module is not installed, run **Install-Module MicrosoftTeams** as an administrator.

1. In the PowerShell prompt, sign in as **MOD Administrator** with the credentials provided to you.

1. In Windows Powershell, enter the following and then press **Enter**. By running the command you will see that the tenant has a default policy that is assigned to all users by default. When a user signs into a phone, they will get the **UserSignIn** experience which is fully featured.

    ```powershell
    Get-CsTeamsIPPhonePolicy

    ```
    ![A screenshot showing the Global IP Phone policy.](Linked_Image_Files/M05_L05_E02_T01_01.png)

1. Run the New-TeamsIPPhonePolicy cmdlet. This command creates a per-user online IP Phone Policy that will lock down the phone to the CommonAreaSignIn experience. It also disables the home screen and the better together functionality with the Teams client.

    ```powershell
   New-CsTeamsIPPhonePolicy -Identity CAP -SignInMode CommonAreaPhoneSignIn -AllowHomeScreen Disabled -AllowBetterTogether Disabled

    ```

1. Run the Get-CsTeamsIPPhonePolicy command. The command will show the Global and the newly created policy

    ```powershell
    Get-CsTeamsIPPhonePolicy

    ```

1. Review the output of the command. You will see the Global and the CAP policy created previously.

    ![A screenshot showing the two created IP Phone.](Linked_Image_Files/M05_L05_E02_T01_02.png)

1. Leave the PowerShell window open for the next task.

### Task 2 - Assign Teams IP Phone Policies to users

In this task, you will connect to Microsoft Teams PowerShell and assign the previously created policy to a user. This policy can only be assigned, managed, and created in PowerShell.

1. You have an active PowerShell window on **MS721-CLIENT01** where you are still signed in as “Admin”.

1. Run the Grant-CsTeamsIPPhonePolicy command. The command will apply the policy to the user created previously. Make sure you replate <LAB DOMAIN> with the UPN associated to the user in the lab.

    ```powershell
    Grant-CsTeamsIPPhonePolicy -PolicyName CAP -Identity CAP_Reception@<LAB Domain>.onmicrosoft.com

    ```
1. The cmdlet does not provide any output. When you are back on the command prompt, leave the window open for the next exercise.

You have successfully provisioned an account for use with a Common Area Phone in Microsoft Teams.

## Exercise 3: Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows & Surface Hub 3

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 120 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy finish configuration of a room resource account for Microsoft Teams Rooms on Windows and Surface Hub 3. You will then test the account and sign into a virtual Surface Hub 3 virtual machine and then manage the room from the Teams Rooms Pro Portal.

### Task 1 - Configure the Room Resource Account's Calendar Processing Settings

In this task, you will sign into Microsoft Exchange PowerShell and configure the mailbox for the room resource account as a Room and Modify Calendar Processing.

    ```powershell
    Connect-ExchangeOnline

    ```

1. In the PowerShell prompt, sign in as **MOD Administrator** with the credentials provided to you.

1. In Windows Powershell, enter the following and then press **Enter**. By running the command, the room resource account will automatically process or deny meeting invites when the room is invited to a meeting based on the room calendar.

    ```powershell
    Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity "CONF_Room1" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -AllowRecurringMeetings $true -DeleteAttachments $true -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $true -RemovePrivateProperty $false -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This is a Microsoft Teams Meeting room!"

    ```

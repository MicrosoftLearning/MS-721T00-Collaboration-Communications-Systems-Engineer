# Lab 04: Manage your Teams Phone environment
# Student lab answer key

## Lab Scenario

Contoso needs to make changes to existing users who are enabled for Teams Voice and add Teams Devices. Whilst making changes, support tickets have been raised due to problems users have reported with connectivity and troubleshooting must be performed.

## Lab Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 180 minutes

## Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Throughout this lab, you will use PowerShell cmdlets that must be customized for your specific lab configuration. In the instructions below, when you see &lt;LAB NUMBER&gt; in a PowerShell command, you should replace it with the LAB NUMBER obtained in Lab 3, Exercise 1, Task 2.
> You will also see &lt;TENANT NAME&GT; used in PowerShell commands and should replace it with the Microsoft 365 TENANT NAME (e.g. M365x01234567) for your Microsoft 365 account.

## Exercise 1: Manage voice users

The Teams IP Phone can now be signed in to by a user or remotely signed in to a common area account.

### Task 2 - Create a resource account and Exchange Online mailbox for Teams Rooms

In the following task, we will use a combination of Microsoft Graph PowerShell, Exchange Online PowerShell, and Teams PowerShell to create and configure a resource account with an Exchange Online mailbox. 

1. Make sure you have the latest Exchange Online PowerShell modules installed with the following cmdlet. If you receive an **Untrusted repository** prompt, select **[A] Yes to all**.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement

    ```

1. Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell, when prompted for credentials, enter the credentials of **Allan Deyoung**:

    ```powershell
    Connect-ExchangeOnline
    
    ```

1. Run the following command to create a new resource account with an Exchange Online mailbox.  Replace &lt;TENANT NAME&gt; and &lt;USER PASSWORD&gt; with the correct values:

    ```powershell
    New-Mailbox -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID mtr01@<TENANT NAME>.onmicrosoft.com -Name "mtr01" -Alias mtr01 -Room -EnableRoomMailboxAccount $true -RoomMailboxPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<USER PASSWORD>' -AsPlainText -Force)

    ```

1. Run the following command to configure the settings on the room mailbox:

    ```powershell
    Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity "mtr01" -AutomateProcessing AutoAccept -AddOrganizerToSubject $false -DeleteComments $false -DeleteSubject $false -ProcessExternalMeetingMessages $true -RemovePrivateProperty $false -AddAdditionalResponse $true -AdditionalResponse "This is a Microsoft Teams Meeting room!"
    ```

### Task 3 - Configure and license resource account with Microsoft Graph

Next, you will use Graph PowerShell to assign the Teams Rooms Pro trial license you acquired in a previous lab and configure the resource account password policy.

1. Open Windows PowerShell as **Administrator** and make sure you have the latest Microsoft Graph PowerShell module installed with the following cmdlet. If you receive an **Untrusted repository** prompt, select **[A] Yes to all**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This command can take some time to run, wait for the prompt in PowerShell to return or not all the Graph sub-modules will install.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Force -AllowClobber

    ```

1. Now that the resource account and mailbox have been created, set the usage location and configure the password to never expire. When prompted for credentials, enter the credentials of **MOD Administrator** and check the box give consent for Graph to manage your organization:

    ![A screenshot asking to provide consent for Microsoft Graph.](Linked_Image_Files/M03_E03_T01_01.png)

    ```powershell
    Connect-MgGraph -Scopes User.ReadWrite.All, Organization.Read.All

    Update-MgUser -UserId "mtr01@<TENANT NAME>.onmicrosoft.com" -UsageLocation US -PasswordPolicies DisablePasswordExpiration

    ```

1. To assign the license, use the **Set-MgUserLicense** cmdlet, and convert the license SKU ID into a PowerShell license type object which is then assigned to the resource account. In the following example, we search for the **Sku  Part Number** to obtain the **SkuId** and then assign it to the account **mtr01@&gt;TENANT NAME&lt;.onmicrosoft.com**:

    ```powershell
    
    $MTRProSku = Get-MgSubscribedSku -All | Where SkuPartNumber -eq 'Microsoft_Teams_Rooms_Pro'
    
    Set-MgUserLicense -UserId "mtr01@<TENANT NAME>.onmicrosoft.com" -AddLicenses @{SkuId = $MTRProSku.SkuId} -RemoveLicenses @()

    ```

Upon completion of these steps, you can view the new Teams Room account in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the account can now be signed-in to a Microsoft Teams Room system using the password provided earlier.

### Task 4 - Prepare to manage devices by creating tags in the Teams Admin Center

1. Microsoft Edge should still be open, you can now see a summary of the results

1. Select Details and scroll down to review the following:

	- Exchange service front door location and SharePoint Online front door locations should have green ticks.

	- Under Microsoft Teams look for green ticks for connectivity, packet loss, latency and jitter.

If the user does not have green ticks for Microsoft teams network performance, check to see if they are using WiFi or can wire directly into their router to confirm if it is an ISP issue or a local network/WiFi issue.

If the front door locations do not have green ticks and they are not using any VPN we may need to contact their local ISP for support. 

You have successfully tested network connectivity and performance from a user’s machine using the Microsoft 365 network test tool.

### Task 5 - Inspect PSTN Usage Reports

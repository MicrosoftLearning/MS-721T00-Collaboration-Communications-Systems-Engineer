# Lab 01: Configure the lab environment
# Student lab answer key

## Lab scenario

In the labs for this course, you are taking on the role of Katie Jordan, Contoso Ltd.’s Teams Voice Engineer. You have deployed Microsoft 365 in a virtualized lab environment, and you have been tasked with completing a pilot project that tests the Voice and Phone device management features in Microsoft Teams as they relate to Contoso's business requirements.

You have just started the pilot project; therefore, in this first lab you will set up a personalized Microsoft 365 user account for Katie that will be used throughout all the labs in this course. This first exercise also requires that you perform several setup tasks that will initialize your trial tenant for the remaining labs in this course. You must configure your trial tenant, create a personalized Teams Service user account in Microsoft 365 for Kate, configure several test users and groups that will be used throughout the remaining labs, and request a certificate signed by a public certificate authority.

## Lab Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 65 minutes

## Instructions

## Exercise 1: Configure your lab environment

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 25 minutes

In this exercise, you will run scripts designed to provision user accounts, groups, teams, and other resources used by the labs in this course. This script will also add your lab's custom domain to Office 365. If you have already added your lab's custom domain, the script will verify that it exists. 

### Task 1 - Identify your lab's public IP address

In the following task you will sign identify your lab’s public IP address to ensure that you can regain access to your lab environment at a later date.

1. Sign in to MS720-CLIENT01 as “Admin” with the password provided to you. You can find the password in the “Resource” section on the right side of the lab window.

1. Open Microsoft Edge and then browse to **http://www.bing.com**.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **What is my IP** and then press Enter.

1. The first result box with the label **Your public IP address** is your IP retrieved by Bing.

1. Copy or write down your public IP address. 

You have successfully identified and stored your IP address. When you restart your lab environment, you will possibly be assigned a new public IP address and need to perform the first task again.

### Task 2 - Retrieve your lab number

The lab number task, updates the o365ready.com DNS server with your lab's public IP address and creates a DNS delegation zone for your lab domain pointing to the DNS server running on MS720-RRAS01. Requests for hosts in your lab domain will be resolved by the DNS server running on MS720-RRAS01.

**Note**: If you have restarted this lab or if it expired and the virtual machines were reset, perform the steps in the knowledge section at the end of this task. You do not need to be issued a new lab number.  

1. You are still signed in to MS720-CLIENT01 as “Admin” with the password provided to you.

1. In Microsoft Edge, browse to **http://www.o365ready.com**.

1. On the Welcome page, select the **Generate Lab Number** tab.

1. In the **IP address** box, enter your public IP address from the previous task.

1. In the **Lab Code** box, enter **MS720**, press Enter or select **Submit**.

1. This lab code will expire 90 days after the start of this course.

1. When the process is completed, you will see a **Student Lab Number** dialog, followed by a 5 digit number. Note this number down and remember it. You will refer to this five-digit number throughout the labs.

1. You will be using all five digits as part of your organization's on-premises domain.

1. Leave the browser window open and continue with the next task.

    ![Screenshot of the o365ready.com website showing the lab number provisioning tool form.](./Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_E01_T02.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you have restarted this lab or if the lab timer has expired and the virtual machines were reset, you will likely have a new public IP address. Perform the following steps to update your lab domain delegation zone's public IP address.

1. In Microsoft Edge, browse to [http://www.o365ready.com](http://www.o365ready.com/).

1. On the Welcome page, select the **Update Public IP Address** tab.

1. In the **Student Lab Number** box, type your five-digit lab number. If you did not write down your original lab number, you can find it by signing in to Microsoft 365 and browsing to the **Domains** feature.

1. In the **Old public IP address** box, type the previously used public IP address. If you did not write down your original public IP address, open a command prompt and try to ping your lab domain name. Although you will not receive a response, the domain name should resolve to IP.

1. In the **New public IP address** box, type the new public IP address retrieved from Bing and then press Enter.

1. Select **Submit** and wait for the update to complete. This may take a couple of minutes.

You have successfully identified your lab number and updated your public IP address.

### Task 3 - Run the CallandMeetLabs.exe script

In the following task you will execute a script to setup your lab environment.

1. You are still signed in to MS720-CLIENT01 as “Admin” with the password provided to you.

1. Open File Explorer and then browse to **C:\Scripts**.

1. Select **CallandMeetLabs.exe**.

1. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, select **Yes**.

1. In the **Office 365 Admin username** box, enter your M365 tenant MOD Administrators account name. You can find your tenant username in the resource section on the right side of the lab window.

1. In the **Office 365 Admin password** box, enter the MOD Administrators password, provided to you.

1. In the **5-digit lab number** box, enter your lab number from the previous task and select **Verify**.

1. The script tries to use the delivered credentials to access your tenant. Ensure the credentials were verified and review the identified public IP address in the blank window.

    **Note**: If the reported public IP address is not the same as your lab's **&lt;public IP&gt;**, verify your public IP address is correct using the steps found earlier in this exercise. If the public IP addresses do not match, cancel and run the script again. If the public IP address you have identified and the public IP found by the script still do not match, contact a lab proctor.

    ![Screenshot of the Lab Provisioning Tool](./Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_E01_T03.png)

1. If you see a **Ready to run script message**, select **Run Script** to prepare your lab tenant.

1. When the script has completed and you can see a **Complete** message, select **Finish**.

    ![Screenshot of the completed Lab Provisioning Tool](./Linked_Image_Files/M01_L01_E01_T03-1.png)

As soon as the script finishes successfully, you have successfully configured your lab environment with the provided scripts.

### Task 4 - Request your public certificate from DigiCert

1. In Notepad, select all the text in the file and then press Ctrl+C or right-click or tap and hold and select **Copy** to copy the contents to the clipboard.

1. Open Microsoft Edge, open a new tab and then browse to **https://www.digicert.com/friends/exchange.php**.

1. On the Microsoft Event CSR Submission page, in the **Paste CSR** box, right-click or tap and hold inside the box, and then select **Paste**.

1. Verify that you have pasted the contents of your certificate request.

1. Under **Certificate Details**, review the common name and subject alternative names (SAN) information that will be assigned to the certificate. Ensure that all SAN entries are lowercase. All SAN entries may not be used for this lab.

1. Under Certificate Delivery, in the **Email Address** and **Email Address (again)** boxes, enter the MOD Administrators account name, which is also used as the users email address.

1. Select the **I agree to the Terms of Service above** check box.

1. Select **Submit**.

# Lab 01: Configure the lab environment
# Student lab answer key

## Lab scenario

In the labs for this course, you are taking on the role of Allan Deyoung, Contoso Ltd.’s Collaboration Communications Systems Engineer. You have deployed Microsoft 365 in a lab environment, and you have been tasked with completing a pilot project that tests the Voice and Phone device management features in Microsoft Teams as they relate to Contoso's business requirements.

You have just started the pilot project. In this first lab you will set up a personalized Microsoft 365 user account for Allan that will be used throughout all the labs in this course. This first exercise also requires that you perform several setup tasks that will initialize your trial tenant for the remaining labs in this course. You must configure your trial tenant, create a personalized Teams Service user account in Microsoft 365 for Kate, configure several test users and groups that will be used throughout the remaining labs, and request a certificate signed by a public certificate authority.

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will assign the required admin permissions to continue with the other labs and exercises in this course.

### Task 1 - Assign Allan Deyoung to the Teams Administrator role

In the following task, you will use the global administrator account MOD Administrator to assign Teams Service Administrator permissions to the account for Allan Deyoung.

1. Log in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin”.

1. Open **Microsoft Edge** and browse to the Microsoft 365 admin center at [**https://admin.microsoft.com**](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

1. On the **Sign in** screen, enter the credentials of the Microsoft 365 **MOD Administrator** with the username and password provided to you.

1. In the upper left navigation, select the three dashes to the left of the organization name to open the full left-side menu.

1. Select **Users** and **Active users** from the menu below.

1. In the **Active users** list, select **Allan Deyoung** to open the right-side panel.

1. Under **Roles**, select **Manage roles**.

1. In the **Manage admin roles** pane, select **Admin center access**.

1. In the list, select **Exchange Administrator** and **Teams Administrator**.

1. At the bottom of the card, select **Save changes**. Admin roles are updated.

1. **Close** the settings pane and leave the browser window open for the next task.

You have successfully assigned the Teams Service administrator permission to Allan Deyoung.

### Task 2 - Validate licenses in the admin portal

In this task you will sign into the clients provided by your training provider and run a certain script also provided by the lab hoster, to understand what licenses are inside the tenant and what licenses are applied.

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” and in the **Microsoft 365 admin center** as **MOD Administrator**.

1. On the upper left side, select the **Navigation menu** with the three dashes then select **Billing** and then select **Licenses**. 

1. Validate you can see 10 of the **Microsoft 365 E5 (no Teams)** licenses are now applied to users, with 5 remaining licenses available. You should also see licenses for the following:
    
    - Microsoft Teams Domestic Calling Plan Trial

    - Microsoft Teams Enterprise
    
    - Microsoft Teams Phone Resource Account Trial

    - Microsoft Teams Premium Introductory Pricing Trial

    - Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Trial

1. Select **Microsoft 365 E5 (no Teams)** to see the users that are assigned that license.

1. Leave the browser open at the end of the task.

You have successfully signed into your test clients and reviewed the overall number of licenses applied to the Office 365 tenant.

### Task 3 - Assign additional Teams licenses to users

As an admin, you can assign the Teams Domestic Calling Plan license that gives users the right to be assigned a phone number and make and receive PSTN calls. In this task, you will activate the **Teams Domestic Calling Plan license** for five users. All users already have an E5 license, so all they need is a calling plan license.

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as **Admin** and in the **Microsoft 365 admin center** as **MOD Administrator**.

1. On the Microsoft 365 admin center page, in the left navigation, select **Users**, then **Active users**.

1. In the **Active users** list, select the checkboxes next to the following users:

    - Alex Wilber
    - Allan Deyoung
    - Diego Siciliani
    - Isaiah Langer
    - Joni Sherman

1. Select **Manage product licenses** at the top of the list of user.

1. In the **Manage product licenses** pane, select **Assign more** and then select the following licenses from the list:

    - Microsoft Teams Domestic Calling Plan
    - Microsoft Teams Premium

1. Select **Save changes** and then **Done** to close the pane.

1. Sign out the **MOD Administrator** with the MA initials in the circle in the upper right-side corner and select **Sign out**.

1. Close the browser window at the end of the task.

You have successfully assigned the licenses to five users and activated Teams Premium features for these accounts. You will continue with additional tasks for assigning phone numbers in a later exercise. 

## Exercise 2: Setup PowerShell for Microsoft Teams administration

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 10 minutes

Several configuration steps of Microsoft Teams in this lab can also be done or must be done through the Microsoft Teams PowerShell module. In this exercise, you will install the Microsoft Teams PowerShell module and validate the correct version number for being ready for Teams Administration tasks during your lab.

### Task 1 – Install the latest Teams PowerShell module

In this task, you will install the latest Teams PowerShell module on your lab client and check the correct version number.

1. You are still signed in to MS721-CLIENT01 as “Admin” with the password provided to you.

1. Select the start button, enter **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator** below PowerShell from the start menu.

1. Confirm the **User Account Control** message with **Yes** to open a window with elevated permissions.

1. When Windows PowerShell window has opened, enter the following cmdlet to download the Microsoft Teams PowerShell module from the PSGallery and Install it:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module MicrosoftTeams -Force
    ```

1. Once the module is installed you will see the command prompt again.

1. Enter the following cmdlet to import the newly installed Microsoft Teams PowerShell module:

    ```powershell
    Import-Module MicrosoftTeams
    ```

1. Now login to Microsoft Teams via PowerShell to confirm you can connect. At the command prompt type the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Connect-MicrosoftTeams
    ```

1. When the **Sign in to your account** window opens, enter the credentials of Allan Deyoung (AllanD@&lt;TenantName&gt;.onmicrosoft.com) to sign in with your Teams Administrator user.

1. Create a new Team to be used throughout the labs in this course by running the following command:

    ```powershell
    New-Team -DisplayName "Sales Group" -Description "Sellers at Contoso" -Visibility Public
